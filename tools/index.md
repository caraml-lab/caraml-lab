To supplement and apply our research, we develop and maintain a variety of software toolkits. Each tackles a different facet of data-efficient machine learning, including data subset selection for efficiently training deep neural networks, targeted selection for improving performance on desired data slices, active learning for label-efficient data procurement, and more. Below are some of the toolkits that we maintain, which is done jointly as part of the DECILE team.
