  description: A C++ toolkit with API support for convex optimization. Jensen implements many convex optimization algorithms across a range of different kinds of convex losses that are commonly used across different kinds of regressors and classifiers. Including convex optimization algorithms such as gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, L-BFGS, and more, Jensen allows for training and deploying models with only a few lines of code while easily supporting future convex optimization algorithms within its framework.
