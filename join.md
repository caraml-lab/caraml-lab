**Graduate Students**
We are predominantly looking for motivated Ph.D. students from the Computer Science department of The University of Texas at Dallas. But We are also excited to welcome students who want to pursue machine learning research from other graduate programs such as Computer Engineering and Software Engineering on a case-by-case basis.

Our goal is to help our students develop a deep familiarity with the computational methods required for deep learning and a strong understanding of one or more deep learning application areas. We provide training in all aspects through group meetings, individual meetings, and a supportive lab environment.

If you have not yet joined one of the Ph.D. programs above, the first step to joining our group is to apply and be admitted to one of these programs. If you are already a Ph.D. student in one of the above programs and are interested in our lab, please contact [Prof. Rishabh Iyer](mailto:rishabh.iyer@utdallas.edu) to set up a time to discuss your interest. Interested applicants either should have taken the ML qualifier and passed or taken it this semester.
