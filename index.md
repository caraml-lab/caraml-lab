# LEVERAGING ADVANCES IN OPTIMIZATION FOR ENABLING EFFICIENT, ROBUST, AND SCALABLE MACHINE LEARNING

CARAML Lab is a research group at the [University of Texas at Dallas, Department of Computer Science](http://cs.utdallas.edu/) led by [Prof. Rishabh Iyer](https://sites.google.com/view/rishabhiyer/home). We are interested in developing efficient, fair, robust, and scalable machine learning algorithms by leveraging theoretical and algorithmic insights from various fields such as combinatorial optimization and subset selection, information theory, continuous, and bi-level optimization.
